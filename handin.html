                                There are too many ways to access fun cheap events. On the home page, there are sections containing the same information. <span class="bold">Upcoming Fun and Cheap Events</span>, <span class="bold">Funcheap’s Top Picks for this week</span> have many overlapping events, but some have images in the thumbnail but others do not.
                                
                                There are filters at the bottom of the page by <span class="bold">Categories</span> and <span class="bold">Locations</span> which is difficult to find. Clicking on a category takes the user to another page.

                                Headings for this website are separated into two columns, making the page look cluttered. The titles are also very long, and some headings are actionable phrases which don't seem suitable as a heading, for example, <span class="bold">Sign up for Funcheap Emails</span>.

                                Large headings are blue with a grey highlight, newsletter categories are also highlighted in grey which makes it difficult to tell at first as a category. A lot of box colours are used to separate out headings from content, dates from description, but overall it doesn’t look very neat.

                                I conducted an analysis using <span class="bold">WAVE.webaim.org</span> and detected a couple of problems. There are missing alternative text to several linked images, many images are missing labels and several empty links. This makes it harder for users to find out more information about an event if the link is missing. <span class="bold">WAVE</span> also detected low contrast errors, which didn’t bother me very much personally.

                        I chose minimal colours as otherwise it was too distracting, and I decided to use yellow and dark navy blue to indicate time of day in the timeline design.
